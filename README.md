# vanilla-core
The Vanilla Network is a deflationary ERC-20 token with decentralized finance at the heart of
its ecosystem driven by Blockchain technology. The premise of this project is to produce
award winning staking and betting decentralized applications (dApps) that appeal to all
betting enthusiasts and those seeking rewards for long-term participation. The engine of the
project is driven by a legacy community from a now defunct project; with a novel recyclable
community fund providing the foundations of the product offering. The overarching aim, by
making use of Blockchain technology is to produce the first truly community driven betting
and staking platform where the house no longer wins.
